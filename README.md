# Lightbearer
Ecki's game submission to HedgeJam #5

- **Time frame:** 3rd April - 17th April
- **Topic:** You only have one

## The Game
**Idea:** You only have one torch. In this top down dungeon puzzler, the environment is covered in darkness. The only source of light is the single torch you have. Try to lighten the environment to the best of your abilities and beware of what lies in the dark...

Lightbearer is a dungeon puzzle game. There is no way to attack other entities, you can only move and pick up your torch.

## Entities
I have only added a handful of game objects. Adding more is probably the easiest way to expand this game with new content. 

- **Torch:** The main game element. Used to see the environment and to interact with other entities as well.
- **Traps:** Static tiles you need to avoid. Stepping on them resets the level.
- **Ghosts:** Just like the Traps, but now moving. They can move left to right or up and down. They switch directions when colliding with something.
- **Doors:** The path to the next level.
- **Keys:** Unlock locked doors.
- **Cross:** Lights up, when the torch is next to it. It makes certain game elements disappear when activated.
- **Blocked Path:** Only allows the player to pass. The torch has to be left behind.
