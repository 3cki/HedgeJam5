# HedgeJam5
Ecki's game submission to HedgeJam #5

- **Time frame:** 3rd April - 17th April
- **Topic:** You only have one
- **Site:** https://itch.io/jam/hedgejam-5

## The Game
The game is still untitled. I am open for recommendations, if you have some :)

**Idea:** You only have one torch. In a top down dungeon crawler, the environment is covered in darkness. The only source of light is the single torch you have. Try to lighten the environment to the best of your abilities and beware of what lies in the dark...
